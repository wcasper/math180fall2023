% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Problem List}
\begin{frame}{Question 1}
\begin{quest}
Harry and Terry are each told to calculate $8-(2+5)$. Harry gets the correct answer. Terry ignores the parentheses and calculates $8-2+5$. If Harry's answer is $H$ and Terry's answer is $T$, what is $H-T$?
\end{quest}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Question 2}
\begin{quest}
Isabella had a week to read a book for a school assignment. She read an average of 36 pages per day for the first three days and an average of 44 pages per day for the next three days. She then finished the book by reading 10 pages on the last day. How many pages were in the book?
\end{quest}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Question 3}
\begin{quest}
Margie's car can go 32 miles on a gallon of gas, and gas currently costs \$4 per gallon. How many miles can Margie drive on \$20?
\end{quest}
\end{frame}

\begin{quest}
Jack wants to bike from his house to Jill's house, which is located three blocks east and two blocks north of Jack's house. After biking each block, Jack can continue either east or north, but he needs to avoid a dangerous intersection one block east and one block north of his house. In how many ways can he reach Jill's house by biking a total of five blocks?

\begin{frame}{Question 9}
\begin{quest}
George walks $1$ mile to school. He leaves home at the same time each day, walks at a steady speed of $3$ miles per hour, and arrives just as school begins.
